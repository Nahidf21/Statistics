## Q : Suppose you have five coins numbered 1-5. Further suppose that when coin 𝑖 is flipped it shows heads with probability 𝑖/5.
## We can generate all possible combinations of values of each of the five coin tosses as follows.

```{r }
c1 <- c(0,1)
c2 <- c(0,1)
c3 <- c(0,1)
c4 <- c(0,1)
c5 <- c(0,1)

x <- expand.grid(c1 = c1,c2 = c2, c3 = c3, c4 = c4, c5 = c5)

x
```

## a. Assuming that all five coins were fair coins (i.e., flipped heads with probability 0.5), use R to determine the expected number of heads.


```{r }
expected_heads <- mean(rowSums(x))
expected_heads 
```

## b. Simulate 10,000 trials of the above experiment flipping five coins. You will need to use the sample() function to do so. I will suggest some code to get you started. Finish the code below and run it to finalize your simulation. Then, use rowSums() to obtain the number of heads for each of your 10,000 trials.

```{r }
results <- data.frame(matrix(nrow = 10000, ncol = 5))
for (i in 1:5) {
  results[,i] <- sample(c(0,1), size = 10000, replace = TRUE, prob = c(0.5, 0.5))
}
num_heads <- rowSums(results)
num_heads
```

## c. Create a histogram of the results of your experiment with appropriately-labeled axes and plot title. Comment on what you see. Why are there no outcomes associated with zero heads?

```{r }
hist(num_heads, main = "Number of Heads in 10,000 Trials", xlab = "Number of Heads", ylab = "Frequency", breaks = seq(-0.5,5.5,1), col = "blue")
```

## d. Suppose one coin is randomly selected and flipped. From your experimental results, find the probability that it is coin 4 given that the result is heads. Then calculate this probability by hand using Bayes’ rule. If you are interested, you can use R to document your math, or you can complete your work (neatly) by hand, take a picture, and import that into your Markdown document using or something similar to the following, where the figure math.png is in the same directory as my Rmarkdown file. Note that the code below is inside of an r chunk.

```{r }
# Number of times coin 4 resulted in heads
coin4_heads <- sum(results[,4] == 1)

# Total number of heads
total_heads <- sum(num_heads)

# Calculate the conditional probability
prob_coin4_given_heads <- coin4_heads / total_heads

# Prior probability that we select coin 4
prior_coin4 <- 1/5

# Prior probability that we get heads
prior_heads <- sum(num_heads) / (5 * 10000)

# Likelihood that we get heads given that we have selected coin 4
like_heads_given_coin4 <- sum(results[,4] == 1) / 10000

# Calculate the posterior probability using Bayes' rule
prob_coin4_given_heads_bayes <- (like_heads_given_coin4 * prior_coin4) / prior_heads

prob_coin4_given_heads_bayes
```
